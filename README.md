This repository contains scripts for a Web Scraping and Data Analysis Project. The project involves two main tasks: scraping titles and preview text from Mars news articles, and scraping and analyzing Mars weather data from a table on a webpage. Using Splinter for automated browsing and Beautiful Soup for HTML parsing, the project focuses on identifying HTML elements and extracting relevant data. This project aims to develop core skills in data collection, organization, analysis, and visualization. By following the provided scripts, users can gain practical experience in handling and interpreting web data.
